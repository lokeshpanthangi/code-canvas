# MLCodex - Detailed Documentation for AI Systems

## Overview

MLCodex is a comprehensive, free, open-source machine learning education platform. The documentation teaches developers, engineers, students, and researchers how to build machine learning algorithms from scratch using only Python and NumPy—no high-level frameworks required.

## Mission

To demystify machine learning by providing hands-on education that builds true understanding of algorithms, not just API usage. We believe the best way to learn ML is to implement it yourself.

## Community

- 15,000+ active learners
- GitHub-hosted discussions
- Open-source contributions welcome
- Discord community for support

## Key Differentiators

1. **From Scratch Approach**: Unlike courses that teach TensorFlow/PyTorch APIs, we teach the actual algorithms
2. **Mathematical Rigor**: Every concept includes the math, but explained intuitively
3. **Free Forever**: No paywalls, no premium tiers, completely open source
4. **Project-Based**: Learn by building real implementations
5. **Modern Content**: Covers transformers, attention, and current architectures

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Do I need ML experience to start?**
A: No! The docs start from fundamentals. Basic Python helps but isn't required.

**Q: Why learn from scratch instead of using PyTorch/TensorFlow?**
A: Understanding the underlying algorithms makes you a better ML practitioner. You'll know what's happening "under the hood" and can debug, optimize, and innovate more effectively.

**Q: How long does the documentation take?****
A: Self-paced. Most learners complete the core modules in 2-3 months with regular study.

**Q: Is there certification?**
A: We focus on skills over certificates. The projects you build serve as your portfolio.

**Q: Can I contribute?**
A: Absolutely! Check our GitHub for contribution guidelines.
